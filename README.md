Tools Used: Alteryx, SQL (MySQL), Power BI, Tableau
Skills Highlighted: Data Profiling · ETL · Data Modeling · Dashboard Development · Business Intelligence · Data Analysis · Public Sector Analytics

📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes over 1.5 million records from Kansas City’s 311 Call Center Service Requests (2007–2021). The dataset includes details on civic service requests, such as case types, departments involved, request status, geographic data, and response times.

The goal of this project was to build a business intelligence solution that enables city officials to monitor trends, identify bottlenecks, and improve response time efficiency across departments.

🔧 Key Objectives
• Profile and stage TSV-based data using Alteryx
• Load cleaned data into a MySQL relational database
• Create an ETL pipeline for scalable reporting
• Build interactive dashboards in Power BI and Tableau for stakeholder insights
• Provide analytical answers to strategic business questions (e.g. response time trends, top categories, geo-distribution)

📊 Business Questions Answered
1. What are the trends in service requests over time (2018–2021)?
2. Which departments handle the most service requests?
3. What are the top 10 fastest categories based on response time?
4. How does workload vary across work groups and neighborhoods?
5. Which areas report the highest number of requests?
6. How has the composition of request statuses changed year over year?
7. What patterns emerge in the average time to close across request types?
